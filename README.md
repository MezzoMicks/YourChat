YourChat
========

Maven-Parent Project for YourChat

The Main-Goals of YourChat are:
  - to allow users to share media of any kind, while having a conversation (especially Pictures with previous)
  - to be customizable
  - to be extensible
  - to allow flexibility in the choice of UI
  - to have the Core-Project to be deployable in every JavaEE6-compliant Container (maybe even less requirements)
  - to be lightweight (low booting times, fast response times)
  - to allow me to practice new technologies on a living project
